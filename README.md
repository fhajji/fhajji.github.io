Tips and Workflows used in Virtual Production

_Work in progress_

Virtual Production for filmmaking is a collection of workflows and techniques for compositing real camera footage with computer generated graphics made with a combination of various 3D software to create the illusion that actors are in a virtually generated environment, that would be too cost-intensive to replicate in reality.

This site _will be_ a compilation of various online tutorials and notes I've been collecting in my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/79ZN2JGEaU), notably about
- filmmaking: general infos about the art and craft of filmmaking, including screenwriting / story telling, pre-production, storyboards, lighting, filmming, post-production.
- unreal-engine: how to use Epic Games' excellent Unreal Engine 5 (UE5) in general, and for filmmaking in particular, e.g. using Sequencer.
- davinci-resolve: using Blackmagicdesign's excellent DaVinci Resolve NLE (non-linear Video Editing software) to stitch everything together, to make VFX in Fusion, colorize to mood, fix audio.
- audio-sound: everything sound- and music-related like e.g. sound design, SFX, music composition techniques, using synths (regular and modular), Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs), etc.
- blender: using Blender 3D to create assets for UE5, or even make whole animated sequences.
- software: all kinds of additional software used in Virtual Production, including useful AI tools.
